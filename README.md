Objective-C custom video player.

OLCVideoPlayer is a custom video player that can do so much more than what the default MediaPlayer can do. The motivation behind this project was to make a video player that we have full controll over, so it has the ability to change play a collection of videos, change volume level, play in background, set time limits per video, smooth playback and so much more !
